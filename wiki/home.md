Welcome to Virtual-AI! This project is where computer graphics and artificial intelligence come together. For the computer graphics, [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) is used, and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for machine learning. This Wiki articles are here to assist you to learn basic assets of these libraries and demonstrate how things are implemented. Unfortunately, the Wiki articles will not cover fundamentals of the C++ or Python programming languages. Without further ado, let's get started!
